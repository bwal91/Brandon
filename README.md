As I finish my time at CodingDojo Bootcamp, I have worked on many projects. Some small and simple, others large and time consuming.
I have provided all of my projects, big and small, here. As you work your way through the projects you can see the development and progress through each. I began with Web Fundamentals for 2 weeks, followed by Python, Ruby and MEAN, each for 4 weeks. I am currently finishing up my time in MEAN and will provide more code as I finish up.
